We loved the residential feel to the building and the neighbourhood, with a train located just around the corner but we walked every where and great to get away from the crowds. \\n<br/>\\n<br/>The two bathrooms, situated side by side (not en-suite to any of the bedrooms) were large and well equipped. This setup is most suited for families. Showers had a lovely pressure.\\n<br/>\\n<br/>The decor is lovely and the large dining table is excellent for gatherings with goodies from the market.

Lot of nice restaurants  in the neighborhood and is it pretty silent and comfortable in spite of being in a busy neighborhood.  Walkable to public transport as well.  Be aware that this Airbnb is on the 5th floor and you need to climb around 90 steps to get there. If you pack light, it should not be a problem at all. We did have to struggle a bit the first day during check in but rest of the time it was an easy climb.

Check-in was so easy with the office being onsite.  We were easily able to store our luggage until the unit was ready. During our stay there was something critical we need to print and the office helped us out immediately.  Also, the electronic key was not working one time when we returned and it was so quick and easy to go down to the office and get it re-activated.  With other places that have offsite offices, this would have been annoying to fix, but was super easy at ApartRamblas108!! LOVED the location!!!! It was almost right across the street from La Boqueria and in walking distance to the Gothic Quarter, Aquarium, Pl Catalunya, El Nacional, etc).  We would definitely recommend this unit!   \n","4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Marija is A very good host.

Lot of nice restaurants  in the neighborhood and is it pretty silent and comfortable in spite of being in a busy neighborhood.  Walkable to public transport as well.  Be aware that this Airbnb is on the 5th floor and you need to climb around 90 steps to get there. If you pack light, it should not be a problem at all.

Also, the electronic key was not working one time when we returned and it was so quick and easy to go down to the office and get it re-activated.  With other places that have offsite offices, this would have been annoying to fix, but was super easy at ApartRamblas108!! LOVED the location!!!!

Lot of nice restaurants  in the neighborhood and is it pretty silent and comfortable in spite of being in a busy neighborhood.  Walkable to public transport as well.  Be aware that this Airbnb is on the 5th floor and you need to climb around 90 steps to get there. If you pack light, it should not be a problem at all. We did have to struggle a bit the first day during check in but rest of the time it was an easy climb.

Check-in was so easy with the office being onsite.  We were easily able to store our luggage until the unit was ready. During our stay there was something critical we need to print and the office helped us out immediately.  Also, the electronic key was not working one time when we returned and it was so quick and easy to go down to the office and get it re-activated.  With other places that have offsite offices, this would have been annoying to fix, but was super easy at ApartRamblas108!! LOVED the location!!!! It was almost right across the street from La Boqueria and in walking distance to the Gothic Quarter, Aquarium, Pl Catalunya, El Nacional, etc).  We would definitely recommend this unit!   \n","4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Marija is A very good host.

Lot of nice restaurants  in the neighborhood and is it pretty silent and comfortable in spite of being in a busy neighborhood.  Walkable to public transport as well.  Be aware that this Airbnb is on the 5th floor and you need to climb around 90 steps to get there. If you pack light, it should not be a problem at all. We did have to struggle a bit the first day during check in but rest of the time it was an easy climb.  Everything else was fine and would stay here again if i come to Barcelona   \n","2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Nice and modern, stylish and cosy appartment in a cenctral area with small cafes and supermarkets. As it lies on a busy street, it is quite noisy, but we felt very comfortable there with two adults and two kids.   \n","3  The location was great and the onsite property manager was extremely helpful!   Check-in was so easy with the office being onsite.  We were easily able to store our luggage until the unit was ready. During our stay there was something critical we need to print and the office helped us out immediately.  Also, the electronic key was not working one time when we returned and it was so quick and easy to go down to the office and get it re-activated.  With other places that have offsite offices, this would have been annoying to fix, but was super easy at ApartRamblas108!! LOVED the location!!!! It was almost right across the street from La Boqueria and in walking distance to the Gothic Quarter, Aquarium, Pl Catalunya, El Nacional, etc).  We would definitely recommend this unit!   \n","4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Marija is A very good host.

Be aware that this Airbnb is on the 5th floor and you need to climb around 90 steps to get there. If you pack light, it should not be a problem at all.

Also, the electronic key was not working one time when we returned and it was so quick and easy to go down to the office and get it re-activated.
